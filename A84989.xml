            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Con≈øtitution of affaires in this County are of ≈øo high importance to the generall good of the whole Land, as we conceive it requi≈øite to have them repre≈øented to the Hou≈øe of Parliament, and to receive directions from thence, to guide the well-affected Subjects in ≈øuch waies as conduce to the e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace, here and el≈øewhere; and to that end the Committee when they returned to the Parliament promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed frequent intercour≈øe, and that tho≈øe who ≈øhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed from hence upon ≈øuch occa≈øions ≈øhould finde their charge and travell well rewarded, whereupon divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the County, having met here at <hi>Yorke,</hi> this day and ye≈øterday, did re≈øolve it nece≈ø≈øary to di≈øpatch the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, with a view of the pre≈øent condition of the Country which they de≈øire you to make known to the Hou≈øe as you ≈øhall finde it nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
            <p>His Maje≈øty hath now withdrawne all his Forces from <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Beverley,</hi> and ≈øent mo≈øt part of his Hor≈øe towards <hi>Newarke</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and intends to advance his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the 20 of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> and by Proclamation
<pb facs="tcp:117657:3"/>to command all mens attendance on his per≈øon, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation which the bearer will deliver will more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. His Army at this pre≈øent con≈øi≈øts e≈øpecially of Hor≈øe which are intended to be about 4000. in ≈øeverall Regiments, in which number we conceive is not included the 500. Hor≈øe which certaine of the Gentry of <hi>Yorke≈øhire</hi> promi≈øe to rai≈øe; nor the Traine of the Court, e≈øtimated at 500. Hor≈øe. For Foot forces, here are very few vi≈øible, and tho≈øe of the ≈øcum of the Countrey, being rai≈øed by beating Drums for Volunteers, yet it is ≈øaid that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is 13000. foot, though in di≈øcour≈øe they declare as if 5000. foot will be ≈øufficient for the de≈øigne, which what it is, or again≈øt whom we know not, otherwi≈øe then is expre≈ø≈øed in the Proclamation, for rai≈øing the Standard: for if it were for defence of the Prote≈øtant Religion, the Lawes of the Land, and priviledges of Parliament ≈øo often repeated, we conceive the Papi≈øts, who hate them all would not ≈øo much rejoyce, nor ≈øhew them≈øelves ≈øo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the ≈øervice, nor make ≈øo frequent re≈øort as now they doe into the≈øe parts, from <hi>Ireland, Lanca≈øhire,</hi> and all parts of <hi>Yorke≈øhires;</hi> and be≈øides we ob≈øerve the King hath ≈øent out warrant to call to the ≈øervice all Recu≈øants Hor≈øe and Armes, and many Recu≈øants, to make them≈øelves capable of commands do re≈øort to Church.</p>
            <p>It is given out that the King goes Southward on Tew≈øday next though of that we can write no certainty; But when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever he goes from hence, he leaves the Earle of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to governe the≈øe Northerne Counties, with authority to rai≈øe forces for defence of them, and a Councell of War to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him; And to terrifie the Subjects and con≈øtraine obedience to the government, it is to be accompanied with a Commi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and this government and Councell, are to re≈øide at <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have already heard how the Gentry of this County
<pb facs="tcp:117657:3"/>were ≈øummoned to appeare before his Maje≈øty at <hi>Yorke</hi> the fourth of this Moneth, where His Maje≈øty made certaine Propo≈øitions to them, which you have ≈øince ≈øeen in print, whereupon the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> Lord <hi>Savill,</hi> Lord <hi>Faulconbridge,</hi> all or mo≈øt of the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Array, and divers other Gentlemen of the Country, met in the Deanry at <hi>Yorke,</hi> and there framed the Petition ≈øent up by M. <hi>Jack≈øon</hi> and M. <hi>Maud</hi> to the Parliament; which though it was carried then with much ≈øecrecy, yet now it is divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and di≈øliked by a great number of the other Gentry of this County, who will prote≈øt again≈øt it in writing as ≈øoon as they can meet with conveniency; yet they which framed it re≈øolve to maintaine it, and hold meetings and con≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations at the Deanry in <hi>Yorke,</hi> where they treate of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of dangerous and high con≈øequence, and contrary to the Lawes of the Land, and the liberty of the Subject; that is to ≈øay,</p>
            <p>To joyne in a≈ø≈øociation with other neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to maintaine the petition afore≈øaid.</p>
            <p>To rai≈øe an Army of hor≈øe and foote for defence of the County under the command of the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to be laid about <hi>Yorke,</hi> and paid by the Country.</p>
            <p>To obteine of the King an able Souldier to command in this Army under the Earle, to whom they intend the Country ≈øhall allow entertainment.</p>
            <p>To con≈øtreine all per≈øons to contribute to the charge of this Army, and to di≈øtreine upon ≈øuch as refu≈øe it.</p>
            <p>And to di≈øable the Subjects to oppo≈øe, or defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves again≈øt this oppre≈ø≈øion, they intend to di≈øarme, and impri≈øon all ≈øuch Gentlemen, as ≈øhall not con≈øent with them, and they have e≈øpecially de≈øigned, for impri≈øoning a great number of Gentlemen, who they ≈øuppo≈øe will give oppo≈øition to their cour≈øes, and they have already di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed part of the trained band, in every regiment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:117657:4"/>to di≈øarme more of them, where they finde danger of oppo≈øition.</p>
            <p>And Sir <hi>Iohn Mallory</hi> in his regiment hath already cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, both money to be furni≈øhed to his Souldiers by the Con≈øtables, and Armes to be taken from the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Propo≈øitions and con≈øultations which are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øpoken of, doe not a little perplex the wel affected ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and their feares encrea≈øe, by divers particular affronts and attempts upon the Gentry of the Country, by the Troopers and others of the Kings Army: as the pillaging of divers Gentlemens Hou≈øes about <hi>Hull,</hi> and pillaging Sir <hi>Henry Cholmelies</hi> Hou≈øe neere <hi>Selby,</hi> on Sunday la≈øt, and Ma≈øter <hi>George Marwoods</hi> Hou≈øe at <hi>Nunmunckton,</hi> five miles from <hi>Yorke,</hi> on Wen≈øday la≈øt. In this of Ma≈øter <hi>Marwoods,</hi> we will relate ≈øome particulars, for your better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>It was done in the day time, and by 24 Hor≈øe or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, part ≈øtayed beyond the River, running clo≈øe by the Hou≈øe, part entred the hou≈øe, and others kept watch, that none ≈øhould come to hinder their attempt; They threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mi≈øtris <hi>Marwood</hi> and her ≈øervants with death, to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover where her husband was: and ≈øwore they would cut him in peeces before her face, and called her prote≈øtant whore, and Puritan whore: They ≈øearched all the hou≈øe, and brake open 17 locks, they tooke away all his money, being about 120. l. and all his plate they could finde; And they pretended, that they had the Kings warrant for their doings; which the King di≈øavowes, and is very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to have his Name ≈øo abu≈øed, and threatens to have them all hanged if they be di≈øcovered; And though it be Ma≈øter <hi>Marwoods</hi> lot to ≈øuffer fir≈øt, yet the loo≈øe people threaten to pillage and de≈øtroy all Round-heads, and name ≈øome particular per≈øons; under which fooli≈øh name Round-head they comprehend all ≈øuch as doe not goe their wayes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:117657:4"/>
            <p>The≈øe beginnings and preparations of mi≈øery, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to be made knowne to all the Kingdome, that the good Subjects may ≈øtand upon their guard; for though we may a≈ø≈øure our ≈øelves that the King will endeavour to pre≈øerve us, yet we finde it is impo≈ø≈øible to re≈øtraine the malice and rage, of bloody Papi≈øts, and faithle≈ø≈øe Athei≈øts; and in time the≈øe mi≈øchiefes will approach other parts, though for the pre≈øent, we lye in the mouth of danger.</p>
            <p>Now towards the redre≈ø≈øe of the≈øe growing evils, and ≈øecuring the peace of this County, and pre≈øervation of tho≈øe peaceable ≈øubjects, intended to be di≈øarmed and left naked to the furie of every malicious adver≈øary; we offer to your Con≈øiderations, the Propo≈øitions following <hi>viz,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That an Order be conceived in Parliament, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all the Kingdome may take notice of it; to this effect, That all well affected and good Subjects (that ≈øhall be plundered, pillaged, or ≈øuffer in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates, by any one of the Cavalleeres or other forces rai≈øed without con≈øent of Parliament) ≈øhall have full reparation of their dammages, out of the e≈øtates of ≈øuch Per≈øons of wealth and quality, who≈øe fortunes lying in the South, doe now re≈øide in Yorke≈øhire, and with their pre≈øence and a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, doe countenance, and further the≈øe di≈øtempers of the Kingdome, and the mi≈øchiefes, that doe happen, and are like to increa≈øe.</p>
            <p>That there may be ≈øpeedily ≈øent to <hi>Hull</hi> a ≈øufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of powder, bullets, Armes, ordnance and other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, with an Order to furni≈øh the Country with them, as there ≈øhall be occa≈øion, e≈øpecially to ≈øuch as ≈øhall be di≈øar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon the con≈øultations held in the Deanery.</p>
            <p>That Commi≈ø≈øions bee ≈øpeedily ≈øent downe from the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> Lord Leivtenant of this County, to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen named in this inclo≈øed paper, or ≈øuch of them as the Hou≈øe ≈øhall elect, for the pre≈øent, to rai≈øe and command the
<pb facs="tcp:117657:5"/>forces of this Country, for ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing of any in≈øurrections or unlawfull Tumults that may happen to ari≈øe.</p>
            <p>That the Sheriffe bee commanded by ≈øpeciall Order of Parliament, to conduct and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them, as the Hou≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives fitting.</p>
            <p>This li≈øt of Gentlemen for Commanding the Country forces, is not intended to di≈øappoint any, of tru≈øt or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who are already nominated, and intru≈øted by the Parliament: nor are they intended to be continued longer then untill ≈øome other provi≈øion by act be concluded on, by the King and Parliament, for ≈øetling and ordering the Militia.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly it is the de≈øire of the well affected in this Country, to receive weekely adverti≈øements from thence, by ≈øome e≈øpecially employed for that purpo≈øe, untill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires be ≈øo ≈øetled, as we may ≈øafely confide in the ordinary po≈øt; for now we neither rightly under≈øtand the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Hou≈øe, nor can we repre≈øent to them ≈øuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as concerne the peace of the Country.</p>
            <p>All which we hope you will bee plea≈øed to repre≈øent to the Hou≈øe, as the unanimous con≈øiderations of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gentry of the Country.</p>
